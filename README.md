# book-app

**Authors**: Gina Pultorak, Sarah Fisher
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This week we are implementing a basic full stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database. We will also add the ability to update the details of a book or remove it from the collection.

Today’s portion of the application involves requesting books from the API. The client can submit a form to search for a book by title or author, and the search results will then be rendered as a list in the browser.

The entire application will be deployed on Heroku.
